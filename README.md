# Seatrout_ENV_Chapter2

# Goal is to join all relevant environmental data downloaded from several different sources (EPA, USGS, Tampa Bay Water Atlas, Southwest Water Management District, St. Johns Water Management District) with the catch observations for young of the year spotted seatrout. 

# Data types include
  * Nutrient data
  * Rainfall data
  * Time Lagged Salinity Data
  * Time Lagged Temperature Data
  * Seagrass Cover
  
# These will be joined with the FIM catch data sets, FIM hydro datasets (contain hydro observations at the moment of the haul), FIM physical datasets (turbidity proxy at the moment of the haul)

# Boosted regression trees will be used to determine variable significance for each estuary.
