## About

This is an R Markdown document. 
This document details how environmental data not available within the FIM dataset are appended to the FIM catch data set. 

## Set Working Directory ###

The working directory will be different depending on whether I work on my personal or work computer. Identify a working directory for:
  * personal_comp
  * work_comp
```r
personal_comp = "~/Desktop/PhD project/Projects/Seatrout/Data/Raw Survey Data/Seatrout FIM Data"
work_comp= "U:/PhD_projectfiles/Raw_Data/Seatrout_FIM_Data/FIMData/NEWNov7"
```

## Load Packages 
* haven-to load sas7bdat data
* dplyr- to do df manipulation

```r
library(haven) 
library(dplyr) 
```

## Import Data Sets
### About the Data
The fisheries independent monitoring data (FIM) contain positive and zero catch observations of Spotted seatrout for every single haul conducted in each estuary since sampling inception.  



Load FIM Data and select the important recruitment months for each zone so that we are only selecting young-of-the-year individuals. Also, there was a typo in variable name so adjust it to be consistent with other dataframes. 

``` r
ap = subset(read_sas("ap_yoy_cn_c.sas7bdat"), month %in% c(6,7,8,9,10,11)) %>% mutate(bUnk=bunk) %>% select(-bunk) 
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
